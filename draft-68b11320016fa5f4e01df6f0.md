## Introduction—

Hi, I’m **Parth Sohaney**, a final-year undergraduate student at **KNIT Sultanpur, India**, with over **two years of active contributions to open source**. My journey in open source has allowed me to collaborate with multiple organizations, including **OWTF (Open Web Testing Framework)** and [**Rocket.Chat**](http://Rocket.Chat), before contributing to **OWASP OpenCRE** through Google Summer of Code.

Beyond open source, my interests and work span across **software development, DevOPS and** **cybersecurity with a strong focus on AI Security**. I enjoy building impactful projects that merge cutting-edge technologies with real-world applications, while also strengthening security practices in modern software systems.

## Why OpenCRE ?

Cybersecurity has always fascinated me , not just as a technical field, but as a **foundation for trust in modern digital systems**. The idea of contributing to projects that directly strengthen global security practices deeply motivates me, and GSoC gave me the perfect opportunity to do so.

With this alignment, I decided to focus on projects under the **OWASP organization**. While reviewing the proposed ideas, I discovered **OpenCRE** and was immediately drawn to its vision. The project’s goal of building a structured, connected **security knowledge graph** highlighted both its technical depth and real-world impact. This combination of innovation and community value made it the ideal project for me to contribute to.
