* ✅ Keep it **technically rich**, but write like you’re explaining it to a smart peer.
    
* ✅ Add **use cases, future impact, and your personal take** on the subject.
    
* ✅ Include **visuals** (charts, diagrams, AI-generated images).
    
* ✅ Limit emojis to key takeaways, lists, or light section headings.
    
* ✅ End with a **call-to-action** or **summary of what you can build with it**.
    

## Why is ever**yone talking about <mark>Agentic AI</mark> ?**

<mark>Market Analysis</mark> : Agentic AI adoption is rapidly rising, with <mark>80% of Indian firms</mark> exploring autonomous agents by 2025 and <mark>86% of global companies</mark> projected to run agentic AI by 2027. Over <mark>70% of generative AI users</mark> are already leveraging agentic systems, showing a strong link between generative and autonomous AI evolution.

Till now we use AI Chatbots to provide responses based on a single interaction. A person makes a query and the chatbot uses [<mark>natural language processing</mark>](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/natural-language-processing/) to reply .

But what if we had a personal assistant that not only does everything AI chatbots can do, but also plans and executes tasks based on a specific goal? That would be amazing, right?

Now imagine the amount of work a company could take off its employees’ shoulders and the time it could save—simply by automating everything using Agentic AI.

This is why the market is so excited about it. Honestly, who wouldn't want free assistance?

## F**rom Prompts to Purpose : The Evolution of AI models -**

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1750769360164/ce54a7b0-0b76-45e1-8a11-d0cdbe86f6f3.png align="center")

You'll get a general idea from the image above, but let me clarify where the confusion starts—

### **Difference between Workflows , AI Agents and Agentic AI —**

**<mark>WORKFLOWS</mark>** - it is a neutral term , which can exist in both Tool Augmented AI and Agentic AI .It is a pipeline containing a series of steps you follow to complete a goal usually in specific order .These steps can be done by humans , Ai tools or both - Let me give you an example -

* 1- You have a PDF containing all Holiday /Leave related policies of the company and the company has made a Workflow , which will provide the answer written in PDF based on the type of question
    
* 2- Even ChatGPT can be a part of <mark>human-driven workflow</mark> , until it is done autonomously.
    
* Answering normal questions or coding related problem are termed as Workflows (in Anthropic Paper) but AI Agents are different.
    

**<mark>TOOL AUGMENTED AI</mark>** (AI Agents) - Lets us understand this with an example of \[[lovable.dev](http://lovable.dev)\] for those who don’t know it is a famous AI tool used to build frontends -

* Now if I want to build a website with Auth and DB connection -
    
* 1- First I will go to Lovable and ask it to create a frontend for me , will also provide it the UI idea and theme — it will use LLM for this
    
* 2- Then if I want to use Clerk service , I will manually go and add it to my website or ask GPT for steps .
    
* 3- For DB connection I will again have to manually connect AWS or any other service to it .
    
* So you get the idea what I wanted to say - here you have to <mark>tell each step manually</mark> , and then LLM generates the code of give me the steps to for it .
    
* If we are using a tool (like lovable or anything else ) , it will perform a function based on my input but will not plan any steps further .
    
* Its like input —&gt;LLM —&gt; output .<mark>You are yourself a planner and a controller.</mark>
    

**<mark>AGENTIC AI</mark>** - this has autonomy and memory , this can reason , plan , decide and act over multiple steps -

* Understanding due to same example - Now if there was an Agentic AI here , I just have to give command “<mark>Make a SAAS webapp for me with Auth and DB (AWS) and payments</mark> ” , it will automatically create a frontend , then plans and execute the Clerk Auth , and yes if clerk auth requires the changes in frontend , it will also manage it automatically and then connects the DB , will also add env variable . At last it will integrate RAZOR pay payment gateway.
    
* And finally will generate you a completely running SAAS webapp.
    
* Now I think you all would have gained a clear understanding , but if not I have made a table for you - below
    
* Example of Agentic AI use cases -
    
* 1- Booking a trip , with flight booking , cab booking , hotel booking etc.
    
* 2 - Automating food ordering , or cold emailing .
    
* The most famous agentic AI tools is **n8n** ,and **Zapier**
    

Here is the table for better understanding -

| **Aspect** | **Tool-Augmented AI** | **Agentic AI** | **Workflow** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Initiation** | You prompt: "Build my frontend" | You say: "Make me a full-stack SaaS app" | You use multiple tools in a pipeline |
| **LLM Usage** | Single-shot per action (e.g., generate HTML) | Multiple times at each decision point (e.g., "Should I use Clerk?") | Human coordinates LLM tools per step |
| **Frontend (**[**Lovable.dev**](http://Lovable.dev)**)** | You run Lovable manually | Agent runs Lovable itself | You manually run it in workflow |
| **Auth (Clerk)** | You ask ChatGPT, then add Clerk | Agent decides to add Clerk automatically | You manually add Clerk |
| **DB (AWS)** | You ask ChatGPT to integrate it | Agent chooses AWS, sets up DB, handles credentials | You run a script or tool to do it |
| **Reasoning & Planning** | You decide each step | AI plans all steps with subgoals | You plan each step and tools execute |
| **Error Handling** | You retry manually | Agent retries or changes tools on its own | You intervene and rerun |
| **Goal-Oriented?** | No — task-based | Yes — understands final goal | Partially — human defines and manages |
| **Autonomy** | None | High | Low to moderate |
| **Who’s in Control?** | You | The Agent | You |

## **Why ‘Just Talking’ Isn’t Enough Anymore: Enter Agentic AI —**

*“Sure, ChatGPT can write your essay. But can it file your tax return end-to-end?”*

I know we’re too good at explaining things to AI, but AI is not just meant for chit-chat. One of the main goals of evolving AI was to increase productivity and reduce time spent on work that can easily be done by us humans.

So now, we need a solution that not only talks, but also plans, executes, updates, and stores. Let me draw a clear line between the old Generative AI and the new Agentic AI —

**<mark>Generative AI</mark> :**

* Trained on huge datasets to **generate content** (text, images, code)
    
* Has no persistent memory (can only remember within the same session, and forgets everything once the chat ends)
    
* No planning. No execution.
    
* Reactive in nature.
    
* Example: “Write a blog about Japan.”
    

**<mark>Agentic AI </mark>** :

* Built on LLMs but empowered with **tools**, **persistent memory**, **goal-setting**, and **multi-step orchestration**.
    
* Learns from feedback and adapts.
    
* Executes actions across systems.
    
* Example: “Plan a Japan trip, check visa rules, create my itinerary, and book hotels.”
    

Think: <mark>ChatGPT vs. AutoGPT</mark>.

### Comparison Table (from <mark>Sapkota et al.</mark>, 2025 and <mark>Publicis Sapient</mark>)

| **Feature** | **Generative AI** | **Agentic AI** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Input** | Prompt | Goal / Intent |
| **Output** | Single response | Multi-step plans and actions |
| **Memory** | Stateless or session-limited | Persistent, contextual memory |
| **Autonomy** | None | Autonomous and proactive |
| **Tool Use** | Plugins or external tools (limited) | Deep integration with APIs and tools |
| **Planning** | None | Task decomposition and stepwise planning |
| **Learning** | Static (pretrained) | Continuous via feedback loops and environment signals |
| **Collaboration** | None | Can coordinate with other agents |
| **Use Case** | Content creation, summarization, Q&A | Decision support, workflow execution, research agents |
| **Examples** | ChatGPT, DALL·E, Bard | AutoGen, LangGraph agents, TaskMatrix.AI |

### Why the Difference Matters :

* **Generative AI** is transformative for creativity, content, and conversational UX.
    
* But it doesn’t solve for **<mark>goal completion</mark>**, **<mark>task orchestration</mark>**, or **<mark>agent-level cognition</mark>**<mark>.</mark>
    
* As [<mark>Publicis Sapient</mark>](https://www.publicissapient.com/insights/agentic-ai-vs-generative-ai) puts it:
    
    > “Generative AI helps create... Agentic AI helps **get things done**.”
    

### In Summary :

* Agentic AI builds on the foundation of generative models.
    
* But it pushes beyond: it’s intelligent, tool-integrated, memory-augmented, and autonomous.
    
* This marks a shift from **<mark>prompt engineering</mark>** to **<mark>autonomous agent design</mark>**.
    

This shift is at the heart of the paradigm explored by Sapkota et al. in their paper: *AI Agents vs. Agentic AI* <mark>(</mark>[<mark>arXiv:2505.10468</mark>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10468)<mark>)</mark>.

## Final Words :

Agentic AI is not the future—**<mark>it’s the now</mark>**. Build it. Break it. Blog about it.

### Project Ideas I got from here :

I will build one stop solutions from many long tasks such as —

1- <mark>Building End_to_End_Trip_Planner</mark> (Booking tickets + booking hotels + Marking destinations on map + Planning the entire trip + option to extend the trip to visit nearby city + etc)

2-<mark>Building Event_Planner</mark> (Taking details of event from you (kind+date+venue) to setting up the menu + sending the request or message to all the nearby caterers/Home chefs for quotation + Deciding the best offer based on rating and price + etc)

3- <mark>Building SaaS through a single command</mark> from building frontend from lovable and adding auth from Supabase and connecting DB to directly deploying it on either vercel or anything .

Let’s see which is more challenging and excites me…
