## Introduction -

Hi, I’m **Parth Sohaney**, a final-year undergraduate student at **KNIT Sultanpur, India**, with over **two years of active contributions to open source**. My journey in open source has allowed me to collaborate with multiple organizations, including **OWTF (Open Web Testing Framework)** and [**Rocket.Chat**](http://Rocket.Chat), before contributing to **OWASP OpenCRE** through Google Summer of Code.

Beyond open source, my interests and work span across **software development, DevOPS and** **cybersecurity with a strong focus on AI Security**. I enjoy building impactful projects that merge cutting-edge technologies with real-world applications, while also strengthening security practices in modern software systems.

## Why OpenCRE ?

Cybersecurity has always fascinated me , not just as a technical field, but as a **foundation for trust in modern digital systems**. The idea of contributing to projects that directly strengthen global security practices deeply motivates me, and GSoC gave me the perfect opportunity to do so.

With this alignment, I decided to focus on projects under the **OWASP organization**. While reviewing the proposed ideas, I discovered **OpenCRE** and was immediately drawn to its vision. The project’s goal of building a structured, connected **security knowledge graph** highlighted both its technical depth and real-world impact. This combination of innovation and community value made it the ideal project for me to contribute to.

## About OWASP and OpenCRE -

The **Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP)** is a nonprofit foundation dedicated to improving software security through open-source tools, frameworks, and resources that are widely used across the industry.

One of its key initiatives, **OWASP OpenCRE (Common Requirement Enumeration)**, acts as a **security knowledge graph** that interlinks multiple standards, frameworks, and best practices such as CWE, CAPEC, and NIST. By providing these cross-references in a structured and accessible way, OpenCRE helps developers, auditors, and organizations align security requirements, improve compliance, and strengthen cybersecurity practices at scale.

## Proposal Deliverables -

In my proposal ([Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QCUSrKVhC5_HvPrTsMGMzJQ_Nm9QqjGJ710Jr3qQcPo/edit?usp=sharing)) , I have given the following deliverables -

* **Making the gap analysis functionality faster** (#[Issue Link](https://github.com/OWASP/OpenCRE/issues/587)) : **optimize the gap analysis functionality** in OpenCRE by improving Neo4j performance, reusing pre-calculated paths, and focusing computations on CREs instead of entire standards. This included **query optimization, Python code efficiency, and streamlined reporting**, ensuring faster, lighter, and more scalable analysis.
    
* **Issues related to MyOpenCRE** (#[Issue Link](https://github.com/OWASP/OpenCRE/milestone/5)) : proposed to integrate **AI-driven mapping** between CREs and standard controls using generative AI models, with a fallback mechanism to flag or suggest new CREs for unmapped items. The solution also included **backend integration with MyOpenCRE**, frontend support for triggering and displaying mappings, and comprehensive unit/integration testing to ensure reliability
    
* **Releasing the Explorer page** (#[Issue Link](https://github.com/OWASP/OpenCRE/milestone/6)) : Needed to figure out why all the links were not rendered on the explorer page even though they were present in the **DataTree (Browser local Storage)**
    

And along with them , I delivered the following as well -

* **Fixed the visual Graphs (Dependency Graph and Zoomable Circle ) of the Explorer** ([Issue\_Link](https://github.com/OWASP/OpenCRE/issues/494)) - Dependency graphs requires filters which could improve the user interaction with it ,and Zoomable circle was not showing up .
    
* **Revamped the OpenCRE frontend -** OpenCRE (Link) frontend was old and outdated so it requires a new look .
