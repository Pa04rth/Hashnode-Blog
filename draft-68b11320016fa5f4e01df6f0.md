## Introduction -

Hi, I’m **Parth Sohaney**, a final-year undergraduate student at **KNIT Sultanpur, India**, with over **two years of active contributions to open source**. My journey in open source has allowed me to collaborate with multiple organizations, including **OWTF (Open Web Testing Framework)** and [**Rocket.Chat**](http://Rocket.Chat), before contributing to **OWASP OpenCRE** through Google Summer of Code.

Beyond open source, my interests and work span across **software development, DevOPS and** **cybersecurity with a strong focus on AI Security**. I enjoy building impactful projects that merge cutting-edge technologies with real-world applications, while also strengthening security practices in modern software systems.

## Why OpenCRE ?

Cybersecurity has always fascinated me , not just as a technical field, but as a **foundation for trust in modern digital systems**. The idea of contributing to projects that directly strengthen global security practices deeply motivates me, and GSoC gave me the perfect opportunity to do so.

With this alignment, I decided to focus on projects under the **OWASP organization**. While reviewing the proposed ideas, I discovered **OpenCRE** and was immediately drawn to its vision. The project’s goal of building a structured, connected **security knowledge graph** highlighted both its technical depth and real-world impact. This combination of innovation and community value made it the ideal project for me to contribute to.

## About OWASP and OpenCRE -

![Projects | OWASP Foundation](https://owasp.org/assets/images/logo.png align="left")

The **Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP)** is a nonprofit foundation dedicated to improving software security through open-source tools, frameworks, and resources that are widely used across the industry.

One of its key initiatives, **OWASP OpenCRE (Open Common Requirement Enumeration)**, acts as a **security knowledge graph** that interlinks multiple standards, frameworks, and best practices such as CWE, CAPEC, and NIST. By providing these cross-references in a structured and accessible way, OpenCRE helps developers, auditors, and organizations align security requirements, improve compliance, and strengthen cybersecurity practices at scale.

## Proposal Deliverables -

In my proposal ([Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QCUSrKVhC5_HvPrTsMGMzJQ_Nm9QqjGJ710Jr3qQcPo/edit?usp=sharing)) , I have given the following deliverables -

* **Making the gap analysis functionality faster** (#[Issue Link](https://github.com/OWASP/OpenCRE/issues/587)) : **optimize the gap analysis functionality** in OpenCRE by improving Neo4j performance, reusing pre-calculated paths, and focusing computations on CREs instead of entire standards. This included **query optimization, Python code efficiency, and streamlined reporting**, ensuring faster, lighter, and more scalable analysis.
    
* **Issues related to MyOpenCRE** (#[Issue Link](https://github.com/OWASP/OpenCRE/milestone/5)) : proposed to integrate **AI-driven mapping** between CREs and standard controls using generative AI models, with a fallback mechanism to flag or suggest new CREs for unmapped items. The solution also included **backend integration with MyOpenCRE**, frontend support for triggering and displaying mappings, and comprehensive unit/integration testing to ensure reliability
    
* **Releasing the Explorer page** (#[Issue Link](https://github.com/OWASP/OpenCRE/milestone/6)) : Needed to figure out why all the links were not rendered on the explorer page even though they were present in the `recordTree` **(Browser local Storage)**
    

And along with them , I delivered the following as well -

* **Fixed the visual Graphs (Dependency Graph and Zoomable Circle ) of the Explorer** ([Issue\_Link](https://github.com/OWASP/OpenCRE/issues/494)) - Dependency graphs requires filters which could improve the user interaction with it ,and Zoomable circle was not showing up .
    
* **Revamped the OpenCRE frontend -** OpenCRE ([Link](https://www.opencre.org/)) frontend was old and outdated so it requires a new look .
    

## Community Bonding Period -

During the initial phase, we had a few introductory meetings where I learned that **Shashanka** had also been selected for the same organization. Shortly after, we were introduced to our mentors—**Ms. Paola**, **Mr. Rob van der Veer**, and **Mr. Spyros**. I was already familiar with Spyros from my earlier contribution period, which made the transition smoother.

In these discussions, **Mr. Rob** highlighted OpenCRE’s ongoing collaborations with other organizations, giving us valuable context about the project’s broader impact. With this guidance, we were well-prepared to begin our work in earnest. **Shashanka was assigned the Gap Analysis issue** and **I also got my first issue to fix Explorer.**

---

## Coding Period Start -

### Addressing my first issue : **Missing Links on Explorer Page (**[**Link**](https://github.com/OWASP/OpenCRE/issues/514)**)**\-

[![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1756473764903/77339edd-b6ba-4923-a1dd-ab1f3d2e27d5.png align="center")](https://opencre.org/explorer)

**Issue:** The **Explorer page** was reported to be missing certain links, even though they appeared correctly in the `recordTree` stored in the browser’s local storage. Due to this inconsistency, the organization had to temporarily route users to an external explorer ([*Zeljko’s Explorer*](https://zeljkoobrenovic.github.io/opencre-explorer/)). My task was to investigate the root cause of this issue and implement a fix.

**Research :** While analyzing past commits related to this issue, I discovered that a contributor, **Dilcheva (**[**GitHub**](https://github.com/dlicheva)**)**, had already made significant progress and her changes were successfully merged. Building on her work, I decided to first identify exactly which links were still missing and then determine how to resolve the inconsistency.

**My Approach :** To begin, I thoroughly studied the Explorer page code and the **providers folder** to understand how the `recordTree` was being generated and whether any console errors were being triggered. As part of this investigation, I exported the complete `recordTree` from the browser’s local storage into a **CSV file** and imported it into my local code editor for detailed analysis.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1756473460156/faaa1608-cb3c-4452-933e-03f8603f30a5.png align="center")

And I also downloaded the “.csv“ from the External Explorer GitHub repo ([Link to csv](https://github.com/zeljkoobrenovic/opencre-explorer/blob/main/data/all_cres.json)) , and then I wrote a program to compare them.

First I wrote the **countLinks.js** file to compare the Links in both the CSVs and as a result , I got the same result -427

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");
const rawData = fs.readFileSync("formatted1.json");
const bigObject = JSON.parse(rawData);
function countNamedSubobjects(obj, targetName) {
  let count = 0;

  if (typeof obj === "object" && obj !== null) {
    for (let key in obj) {
      if (
        key === targetName &&
        typeof obj[key] === "object" &&
        obj[key] !== null
      ) {
        count++;
      }

      // Recursively check nested objects
      if (typeof obj[key] === "object" && obj[key] !== null) {
        count += countNamedSubobjects(obj[key], targetName);
      }
    }
  }
  return count;
}
const targetName = "links";
console.log(
  `Total subobjects with name "${targetName}":`,
  countNamedSubobjects(bigObject, targetName)
);
```

Now , I sort of got the hint , that it might be a case that after Diana’s commit the error was resolved but not proved , so I wrote another code to compare the names directly to be 100% sure that this is the case .

**CompareNames.js** Files -

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");
function extractAllNames(obj, names = []) {
  if (typeof obj !== "object" || obj === null) return names;
  if (obj.hasOwnProperty("name") && typeof obj.name === "string") {
    names.push(obj.name);
  }
  for (const key in obj) {
    if (typeof obj[key] === "object") {
      extractAllNames(obj[key], names);
    }
  }
  return names;
}
function main() {
  const [, , file1, file2] = process.argv;
  if (!file1 || !file2) {
    process.exit(1);
  }
  const json1 = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(file1, "utf8"));
  const json2 = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(file2, "utf8"));
  // Recursively extract all names
  const names1 = Array.from(new Set(extractAllNames(json1)));
  const names2 = Array.from(new Set(extractAllNames(json2)));
  const set1 = new Set(names1);
  const set2 = new Set(names2);
  const missingIn2 = names1.filter((name) => !set2.has(name));
  const missingIn1 = names2.filter((name) => !set1.has(name));
  console.log(`Names in ${file1} but not in ${file2}:`, missingIn2);
  console.log(`Names in ${file2} but not in ${file1}:`, missingIn1);
}
main();
```

After this file’s output, I was 100% sure that all the CREs were there in the `recordTree` .

Now , my last task was to make sure all of them rendered correctly on the frontend . So I took , full screenshot of the frontend , and extracted the CRES from that link .

**Result** : As a result, I assured the maintainers that all the CREs do render on the frontend by providing them the full proof result, I gave the whole credit to Diana for this who solved this error last year .

### Second Issue : Fixing the Circle Graph -

**Issue :** Circle graph has console errors and was not rendering , as you can see in the graph

See the image below :

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1756486881636/ad2ff780-1fd2-4292-ab34-322c93b534ac.png align="center")

**Research** : I analyzed the console errors and the `circles.tsx` file and found that for any component , [`d.data`](http://d.data)`.displayName` is undefined .

To solve this , I added checks to better diagnose the issue and resolved it (turned out to be an edge case) .And after solving this edge case , the circle graph starts rendering - (PR-1)

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1756488271519/f2cb23f4-b6ee-443e-aeb6-0e365f6e9ca1.png align="center")

**Adding extra enhancement to this Graph : -**

Later , the Rob Sir asked me to add the following enhancements to this graph - ([ISSUE LINK](https://github.com/OWASP/OpenCRE/issues/614))

* when a circle is hovered and highlighed (black circle): always put its label on screen - perhaps where the mouse is - please experiment. And show it in full text without truncating - that will then also become a way for the user to view the full title without it being truncated.
    
* also do this hover labeling for the white circles which are the deep level CREs
    
* Remove "CRE: " before the circle titems, so we can see more of the rest of the title before it gets truncated
    
* try to display the title for every circle if there is room for it
    
* keep showing the circle labels in the deepest zoom levels because currently the deepest levels do not show any text at all
    
* also: add a zoom out button (with a minus) because the current zoom out is not obvious
    
* add a breadcrumb in text, showing the hierarchy that you came through (nice to have): Technical application security controls &gt; file handling &gt; file upload
    

So , I made the commits to solve it - Check this- ([PR](https://github.com/OWASP/OpenCRE/pull/616)) , **it also have a Video depicting my work in the conversation.**

**Result : -**

**Last enhancements in the graph -**

There are 2 extra enhancements , which Rob Sir told me to integrate in it —

1- **Solving the graph resize issue (No.3 on table):**

**Cause of this error** : D3 circles don't resize with the browser window because the drawing logic within the `useEffect` hook is not re-running when the window dimensions change

**Solution** : Moved size outside the `useEffect` and added it to dependency

2-**Removing the line artefacts on  the leafs of the current selected circle (No.4 on table)**

**Problem :** There were small lines with no headings are appearing when zoomed in to leaf nodes

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1756490274330/729f87a4-7db2-43a0-b660-a91cda038390.png align="left")

**Solution :** To solve this issue I added a case to filter the nodes to only include those that have children (i.e., are not leaves)**, ( Check the PR- SNo. 4 on table)**

### **Third Issue : Enhancing Dependency Graph -**

**Issue :** The graph was not loading/rendering initially and have some console errors. Furthur , I was asked by Paola Ma’am to add some unique features which will enhance user interaction with the graph such as filtering menu , color coding etc .

Below is the screenshot depicting the error -

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1756552359200/129db858-4839-41dd-b984-145ffcd7ef1b.png align="center")

**Solution of Rendering issue** : For solving the above issue , I analyze the console log errors and get to know that  it is due to calling  `.reduce()`  on empty array .Mainly this happens when data is not loaded {this was the reason ,we were unable to see the data in incognito in first run but able to see it afterwards} , so I put a command to reload when `dataTree` is empty , automatically (changing `useEffect`) , and have given 0 as an initial value to `reduce()`  array .I have attached the error as first image and the part of code where I have made the changes in the 2nd image .

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1756552478822/2dd9f916-eb37-4efb-acaf-dfc2cdc58f37.png align="center")

After the above changes the graph loads completely normal -

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1756553268975/15ae19e7-e4a1-40b5-809a-3075dd8dbc38.png align="center")

**Adding Enhancements-**

The following are the enhancements we need to make in the force graph :

* **Guided Initial Load** → Show dropdowns first (All CREs left, Standard right) before rendering the graph to avoid overwhelming users.
    
* **Interactive Nodes** → Make clusters/nodes clickable to reveal details, linked standards, or mappings.
    
* **Progressive Expansion** → Reduce clutter by loading smaller subsets first, with expandable clusters/groups on click.
    
* **Smart Filters & Performance** → Add filters (framework, CRE category, mapping type) and optimize loading via lazy-loading, caching, and preloading.
    
* **Onboarding & Consistency** → Provide tooltips/instructions and align dropdowns/UI with Map Analysis & Explorer pages for familiarity.
    

**Solution -**

I have made the following changes in the `ForceGraph.tsx` file and **in the PR (SNo.-2) you may see the attached video.**

**Changes in Force Graph file :**

* **Dropdown & Filtering Setup** → Defined state variables for CRE/Standard dropdowns, added “Show All” checkbox, and included counts next to options.
    
* **Data Handling Improvements** → Built CRE options directly from the datastore, grouped standards by base name, and added a helper for clean IDs.
    
* **Graph Population Simplification** → Reworked logic to collect all data first, then filter, making traversal cleaner and easier to debug.
    
* **Recursive Utility Functions** → Added functions to fetch all standards and handle combined options.
    
* **Code Clarity & Visuals** → Added explanatory comments and restored original graph colors for consistency.
    

**Result :** Now user can easily interact with the graph and use it as per his needs -

Below is the screenshot of the force graph after the changes -

**List of Pull Requests -**

**Note-** The First PR in the following table solves 2 issues collectively ( Circle Graph and Force graph ).So I have added this same PR link in both the tables (Circle Graph and here)

### **Fourth Issue : New OpenCRE Frontend -**

Below is the picture of Old OpenCRE frontend -

**Requirements -** OpenCRE frontend was decent , and was fulfilling the requirements , but now it need an update , Mentors asked me to create a new frontend for OpenCRE , so I first create the frontend separately as a react project and then I merged it in main OpenCRE code .

Deployed Link of that Separate React project - ([Link](https://opencre.parthsohaney.online/))

The portfolio given to me for reference - ([Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s6YLVtubFVCUnE10j6UiiqMwB0lyJvYP/view?usp=sharing))

**Solution with challenges -**

Here are the changes which I did for integrating our new frontend --

* Need to change the code of Search page
    
* Because of the conflict within the search page over the common name "Search" , which was export component name and also a react component name , I need to change the name of export component to "Search\_Page"
    
* After updating the react-router -dom ,I got the error in each file using "{id}" param , so i need to change the way they are declared
    
* In router.tsx file , `<Route component={...}>` prop had very strict type requirements that conflicted with the old library versions in our project, causing an error. so I switched to the more flexible `<Route render={...}>` prop, which accepts a function to specify what to render, avoiding the strict type error.
    
* Due to the `contentBase` configuration in `devServer`, the `www` folder was initially not being recognized, which prevented images from rendering properly on [`localhost`](http://localhost). I resolved this by explicitly adding the correct path to the configuration—now all files are visible during development.
    
* Additionally, there was no `index.html` code to render the logo, so I added it. The original frontend I built for OpenCRE was developed using Vite with React.js, which introduces different conventions (e.g., handling logos via `favicon.ico`, using Tailwind CSS). However, our current project uses a more traditional setup (a bit dated, jokingly speaking), so I had to adapt by converting Tailwind CSS to `.scss` and manually updating `index.html` to include the logo. These may seem like small changes, but I'm learning a lot through this process—huge thanks to OpenCRE for the opportunity.
    

Result : OpenCRE has now its new frontend , In the PR , I have also attached the video showing the whole new frontend .
