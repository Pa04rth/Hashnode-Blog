## Introduction -

Hi, I’m **Parth Sohaney**, a final-year undergraduate student at **KNIT Sultanpur, India**, with over **two years of active contributions to open source**. My journey in open source has allowed me to collaborate with multiple organizations, including **OWTF (Open Web Testing Framework)** and [**Rocket.Chat**](http://Rocket.Chat), before contributing to **OWASP OpenCRE** through Google Summer of Code.

Beyond open source, my interests and work span across **software development, DevOPS and** **cybersecurity with a strong focus on AI Security**. I enjoy building impactful projects that merge cutting-edge technologies with real-world applications, while also strengthening security practices in modern software systems.

## Why OpenCRE ?

Cybersecurity has always fascinated me , not just as a technical field, but as a **foundation for trust in modern digital systems**. The idea of contributing to projects that directly strengthen global security practices deeply motivates me, and GSoC gave me the perfect opportunity to do so.

With this alignment, I decided to focus on projects under the **OWASP organization**. While reviewing the proposed ideas, I discovered **OpenCRE** and was immediately drawn to its vision. The project’s goal of building a structured, connected **security knowledge graph** highlighted both its technical depth and real-world impact. This combination of innovation and community value made it the ideal project for me to contribute to.

## About OWASP and OpenCRE -

![Projects | OWASP Foundation](https://owasp.org/assets/images/logo.png align="left")

The **Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP)** is a nonprofit foundation dedicated to improving software security through open-source tools, frameworks, and resources that are widely used across the industry.

One of its key initiatives, **OWASP OpenCRE (Open Common Requirement Enumeration)**, acts as a **security knowledge graph** that interlinks multiple standards, frameworks, and best practices such as CWE, CAPEC, and NIST. By providing these cross-references in a structured and accessible way, OpenCRE helps developers, auditors, and organizations align security requirements, improve compliance, and strengthen cybersecurity practices at scale.

## Proposal Deliverables -

In my proposal ([Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QCUSrKVhC5_HvPrTsMGMzJQ_Nm9QqjGJ710Jr3qQcPo/edit?usp=sharing)) , I have given the following deliverables -

* **Making the gap analysis functionality faster** (#[Issue Link](https://github.com/OWASP/OpenCRE/issues/587)) : **optimize the gap analysis functionality** in OpenCRE by improving Neo4j performance, reusing pre-calculated paths, and focusing computations on CREs instead of entire standards. This included **query optimization, Python code efficiency, and streamlined reporting**, ensuring faster, lighter, and more scalable analysis.
    
* **Issues related to MyOpenCRE** (#[Issue Link](https://github.com/OWASP/OpenCRE/milestone/5)) : proposed to integrate **AI-driven mapping** between CREs and standard controls using generative AI models, with a fallback mechanism to flag or suggest new CREs for unmapped items. The solution also included **backend integration with MyOpenCRE**, frontend support for triggering and displaying mappings, and comprehensive unit/integration testing to ensure reliability
    
* **Releasing the Explorer page** (#[Issue Link](https://github.com/OWASP/OpenCRE/milestone/6)) : Needed to figure out why all the links were not rendered on the explorer page even though they were present in the `recordTree` **(Browser local Storage)**
    

And along with them , I delivered the following as well -

* **Fixed the visual Graphs (Dependency Graph and Zoomable Circle ) of the Explorer** ([Issue\_Link](https://github.com/OWASP/OpenCRE/issues/494)) - Dependency graphs requires filters which could improve the user interaction with it ,and Zoomable circle was not showing up .
    
* **Revamped the OpenCRE frontend -** OpenCRE ([Link](https://www.opencre.org/)) frontend was old and outdated so it requires a new look .
    

## Community Bonding Period -

During the initial phase, we had a few introductory meetings where I learned that **Shashanka** had also been selected for the same organization. Shortly after, we were introduced to our mentors—**Ms. Paola**, **Mr. Rob van der Veer**, and **Mr. Spyros**. I was already familiar with Spyros from my earlier contribution period, which made the transition smoother.

In these discussions, **Mr. Rob** highlighted OpenCRE’s ongoing collaborations with other organizations, giving us valuable context about the project’s broader impact. With this guidance, we were well-prepared to begin our work in earnest. Shashanka was assigned the Gap Analysis issue and I also got my first issue to fix Explorer.

## Coding Period Start -

### Addressing my first issue : **Missing Links on Explorer Page (**[**Link**](https://github.com/OWASP/OpenCRE/issues/514)**)**\-

[![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1756473764903/77339edd-b6ba-4923-a1dd-ab1f3d2e27d5.png align="center")](https://opencre.org/explorer)

**Issue:** The **Explorer page** was reported to be missing certain links, even though they appeared correctly in the `recordTree` stored in the browser’s local storage. Due to this inconsistency, the organization had to temporarily route users to an external explorer ([*Zeljko’s Explorer*](https://zeljkoobrenovic.github.io/opencre-explorer/)). My task was to investigate the root cause of this issue and implement a fix.

**Research :** While analyzing past commits related to this issue, I discovered that a contributor, **Dilcheva (**[**GitHub**](https://github.com/dlicheva)**)**, had already made significant progress and her changes were successfully merged. Building on her work, I decided to first identify exactly which links were still missing and then determine how to resolve the inconsistency.

**My Approach :** To begin, I thoroughly studied the Explorer page code and the **providers folder** to understand how the `recordTree` was being generated and whether any console errors were being triggered. As part of this investigation, I exported the complete `recordTree` from the browser’s local storage into a **CSV file** and imported it into my local code editor for detailed analysis.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1756473460156/faaa1608-cb3c-4452-933e-03f8603f30a5.png align="center")

And I also downloaded the “.csv“ from the External Explorer GitHub repo ([Link to csv](https://github.com/zeljkoobrenovic/opencre-explorer/blob/main/data/all_cres.json)) , and then I wrote a program to compare them.

First I wrote the **countLinks.js** file to compare the Links in both the CSVs and as a result , I got the same result -427

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");
const rawData = fs.readFileSync("formatted1.json");
const bigObject = JSON.parse(rawData);
function countNamedSubobjects(obj, targetName) {
  let count = 0;

  if (typeof obj === "object" && obj !== null) {
    for (let key in obj) {
      if (
        key === targetName &&
        typeof obj[key] === "object" &&
        obj[key] !== null
      ) {
        count++;
      }

      // Recursively check nested objects
      if (typeof obj[key] === "object" && obj[key] !== null) {
        count += countNamedSubobjects(obj[key], targetName);
      }
    }
  }
  return count;
}
const targetName = "links";
console.log(
  `Total subobjects with name "${targetName}":`,
  countNamedSubobjects(bigObject, targetName)
);
```

Now , I sort of got the hint , that it might be a case that after Diana’s commit the error was resolved but not proved , so I wrote another code to compare the names directly to be 100% sure that this is the case .

**CompareNames.js** Files -

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");
function extractAllNames(obj, names = []) {
  if (typeof obj !== "object" || obj === null) return names;
  if (obj.hasOwnProperty("name") && typeof obj.name === "string") {
    names.push(obj.name);
  }
  for (const key in obj) {
    if (typeof obj[key] === "object") {
      extractAllNames(obj[key], names);
    }
  }
  return names;
}
function main() {
  const [, , file1, file2] = process.argv;
  if (!file1 || !file2) {
    process.exit(1);
  }
  const json1 = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(file1, "utf8"));
  const json2 = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(file2, "utf8"));
  // Recursively extract all names
  const names1 = Array.from(new Set(extractAllNames(json1)));
  const names2 = Array.from(new Set(extractAllNames(json2)));
  const set1 = new Set(names1);
  const set2 = new Set(names2);
  const missingIn2 = names1.filter((name) => !set2.has(name));
  const missingIn1 = names2.filter((name) => !set1.has(name));
  console.log(`Names in ${file1} but not in ${file2}:`, missingIn2);
  console.log(`Names in ${file2} but not in ${file1}:`, missingIn1);
}
main();
```

After this file’s output, I was 100% sure that all the CREs were there in the `recordTree` .

Now , my last task was to make sure all of them rendered correctly on the frontend . So I took , full screenshot of the frontend , and extracted the CRES from that link .

**Result** : As a result, I assured the maintainers that all the CREs do render on the frontend by providing them the full proof result, I gave the whole credit to Diana for this who solved this error last year .

### Second Issue : Fixing the Circle Graph -

**Issue :** Circle graph has console errors and was not rendering , as you can see in the graph

See the image below :

**Research** : I analyzed the console errors and the `circles.tsx` file and found that for any component , [`d.data`](http://d.data)`.displayName` is undefined .

To solve this , I added checks to better diagnose the issue and resolved it (turned out to be an edge case) .And after solving this edge case , the circle graph starts rendering - (PR-1)

**Adding extra enhancement to this Graph : -**

Later , the Rob Sir asked me to add the following enhancements to this graph - ([ISSUE LINK](https://github.com/OWASP/OpenCRE/issues/614))

* when a circle is hovered and highlighed (black circle): always put its label on screen - perhaps where the mouse is - please experiment. And show it in full text without truncating - that will then also become a way for the user to view the full title without it being truncated.
    
* also do this hover labeling for the white circles which are the deep level CREs
    
* Remove "CRE: " before the circle titems, so we can see more of the rest of the title before it gets truncated
    
* try to display the title for every circle if there is room for it
    
* keep showing the circle labels in the deepest zoom levels because currently the deepest levels do not show any text at all
    
* also: add a zoom out button (with a minus) because the current zoom out is not obvious
    
* add a breadcrumb in text, showing the hierarchy that you came through (nice to have): Technical application security controls &gt; file handling &gt; file upload
    

So , I made the commits to solve it - Check this- ([PR](https://github.com/OWASP/OpenCRE/pull/616)) , **it also have a Video depicting my work in the conversation.**

**Result : -**

**Last enhancements in the graph -**

There are 2 extra enhancements , which Rob Sir told me to integrate in it —

1- **Solving the graph resize issue (No.3 on table):**

**Cause of this error** : D3 circles don't resize with the browser window because the drawing logic within the `useEffect` hook is not re-running when the window dimensions change

**Solution** : Moved size outside the `useEffect` and added it to dependency

2-**Removing the line artefacts on  the leafs of the current selected circle (No.4 on table)**

**Problem :**

**Solution :** To solve this issue I added a case to filter the nodes to only include those that have children (i.e., are not leaves)**, ( Check the PR- SNo. 4 on table)**
