## Why is ever**yone talking about <mark>Agentic AI</mark> ?**

Till now we use AI Chatbots to provide responses based on a single interaction. A person makes a query and the chatbot uses [natural language processing](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/natural-language-processing/) to reply .

But what if we had a personal assistant that not only does everything AI chatbots can do, but also plans and executes tasks based on a specific goal? That would be amazing, right?

Now imagine the amount of work a company could take off its employees‚Äô shoulders and the time it could save‚Äîsimply by automating everything using Agentic AI.

This is why the market is so excited about it. Honestly, who wouldn't want free assistance?

## F**rom Prompts to Purpose : The Evolution of AI models -**

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1750769360164/ce54a7b0-0b76-45e1-8a11-d0cdbe86f6f3.png align="center")

You'll get a general idea from the image above, but let me clarify where the confusion starts‚Äî

### **Difference between Workflows , AI Agents AND Agentic AI ‚Äî**

**<mark>WORKFLOWS</mark>** - it is a neutral term , which can exist in both Tool Augmented AI and Agentic AI .It is a pipeline containing a series of steps you follow to complete a goal usually in specific order .These steps can be done by humans , Ai tools or both - Let me give you an example -

* 1- You have a PDF containing all Holiday /Leave related policies of the company and the company has made a Workflow , which will provide the answer written in PDF based on the type of question
    
* 2- Even ChatGPT can be a part of <mark>human-driven workflow</mark> , until it is done autonomously.
    
* Answering normal questions or coding related problem are termed as Workflows (in Anthropic Paper) but AI Agents are different.
    

**<mark>TOOL AUGMENTED AI</mark>** (AI Agents) - Lets us understand this with an example of \[[lovable.dev](http://lovable.dev)\] for those who don‚Äôt know it is a famous AI tool used to build frontends -

* Now if I want to build a website with Auth and DB connection -
    
* 1- First I will go to Lovable and ask it to create a frontend for me , will also provide it the UI idea and theme ‚Äî it will use LLM for this
    
* 2- Then if I want to use Clerk service , I will manually go and add it to my website or ask GPT for steps .
    
* 3- For DB connection I will again have to manually connect AWS or any other service to it .
    
* So you get the idea what I wanted to say - here you have to <mark>tell each step manually</mark> , and then LLM generates the code of give me the steps to for it .
    
* If we are using a tool (like lovable or anything else ) , it will perform a function based on my input but will not plan any steps further .
    
* Its like input ‚Äî&gt;LLM ‚Äî&gt; output .<mark>You are yourself a planner and a controller.</mark>
    

**<mark>AGENTIC AI</mark>** - this has autonomy and memory , this can reason , plan , decide and act over multiple steps -

* Understanding due to same example - Now if there was an Agentic AI here , I just have to give command ‚Äú<mark>Make a SAAS webapp for me with Auth and DB (AWS) and payments</mark> ‚Äù , it will automatically create a frontend , then plans and execute the Clerk Auth , and yes if clerk auth requires the changes in frontend , it will also manage it automatically and then connects the DB , will also add env variable . At last it will integrate RAZOR pay payment gateway.
    
* And finally will generate you a completely running SAAS webapp.
    
* Now I think you all would have gained a clear understanding , but if not I have made a table for you - below
    
* Example of Agentic AI use cases -
    
* 1- Booking a trip , with flight booking , cab booking , hotel booking etc.
    
* 2 - Automating food ordering , or cold emailing .
    
* The most famous agentic AI tools is **n8n** ,and **Zapier**
    

Here is the table for better understanding -

| **Aspect** | **Tool-Augmented AI** | **Agentic AI** | **Workflow** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Initiation** | You prompt: "Build my frontend" | You say: "Make me a full-stack SaaS app" | You use multiple tools in a pipeline |
| **LLM Usage** | Single-shot per action (e.g., generate HTML) | Multiple times at each decision point (e.g., "Should I use Clerk?") | Human coordinates LLM tools per step |
| **Frontend (**[**Lovable.dev**](http://Lovable.dev)**)** | You run Lovable manually | Agent runs Lovable itself | You manually run it in workflow |
| **Auth (Clerk)** | You ask ChatGPT, then add Clerk | Agent decides to add Clerk automatically | You manually add Clerk |
| **DB (AWS)** | You ask ChatGPT to integrate it | Agent chooses AWS, sets up DB, handles credentials | You run a script or tool to do it |
| **Reasoning & Planning** | You decide each step | AI plans all steps with subgoals | You plan each step and tools execute |
| **Error Handling** | You retry manually | Agent retries or changes tools on its own | You intervene and rerun |
| **Goal-Oriented?** | No ‚Äî task-based | Yes ‚Äî understands final goal | Partially ‚Äî human defines and manages |
| **Autonomy** | None | High | Low to moderate |
| **Who‚Äôs in Control?** | You | The Agent | You |

## **Why ‚ÄòJust Talking‚Äô Isn‚Äôt Enough Anymore: Enter Agentic AI ‚Äî**

*‚ÄúSure, ChatGPT can write your essay. But can it file your tax return end-to-end?‚Äù*

**<mark>Generative AI</mark> :**

* Trained on huge datasets to **generate content** (text, images, code)
    
* Has no persistent memory (can only remember within the same session, and forgets everything once the chat ends)
    
* No planning. No execution.
    
* Reactive in nature.
    
* Example: ‚ÄúWrite a blog about Japan.‚Äù
    

**<mark>Agentic AI </mark>** :

* Built on LLMs but empowered with **tools**, **persistent memory**, **goal-setting**, and **multi-step orchestration**.
    
* Learns from feedback and adapts.
    
* Executes actions across systems.
    
* Example: ‚ÄúPlan a Japan trip, check visa rules, create my itinerary, and book hotels.‚Äù
    

Think: <mark>ChatGPT vs. AutoGPT</mark>.

### Comparison Table (Referred from [<mark>Sapkota et al.</mark>,](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10468) 2025):

| **Feature** | **Generative AI** | **Agentic AI** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input | Prompt | Goal / Intent |
| Output | Single response | Multi-step actions |
| Memory | Stateless | Persistent / Contextual |
| Autonomy | None | Self-directed |
| Tool Use | Plugin-based (manual) | Deep, recursive, planned |
| Planning | Not supported | Task decomposition supported |
| **Learning** | Frozen weights | Feedback loop, self-improving |
